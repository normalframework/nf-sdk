# Welcome to the NF example docker-compose.  This file should stand up
# a mostly functioning NF instance on your desktop.  Before running
# you should just check a few things:
#  1. several containers need a writable volume, which this file puts in /tmp by default
#  2. if the BACnet service fails to start, you may need to specify
#   which interface to use in its environment.
#
# This file runs in host networking mode to allow you to discovery
# BACnet devices on your local network.
#
# This will only work on Linux; host networking is not supported in Docker for Mac.

services:

  # the main container which runs all the NF services, load balancer,
  # and management console.

  # Most persistent data is in redis.  This is essentially an
  #  unmodified upstream with RediSearch and RedisTimeseries installed.
