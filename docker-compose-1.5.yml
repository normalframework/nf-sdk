# Welcome to the NF example docker-compose.  This file should stand up
# a mostly functioning NF instance on your desktop.  Before running
# you should just check a few things:
#  1. several containers need a writable volume, which this file puts in /tmp by default
#  2. if the BACnet service fails to start, you may need to specify
#   which interface to use in its environment.
#
# This compose file runs entirely in a docker internal network, along
# with a simple BACnet simulator.
